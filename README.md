## WaterRecognition
This repository contains all programs, models and results files needed for my high-school computer science thesis. Basically, there are 3 types of models built here (from high complexity to low):
 - Deep Learning Neural Networks (including CNNs)
 - Machine Learning Models (Stochastic Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression)
 - Traditional computer vision algorithm (Otsu's Method)
 
The dataset used for training and testing the models: https://www.kaggle.com/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies. This dataset contains pairs of source images (satellite images) and mask images (segmented maps, black and white, categorized by water and non-water).
