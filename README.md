## WaterRecognition
This repository contains all algorithms and code needed for my high-school computer science thesis. Basically, there are 3 types of models built here (from high-complexity to low):
 - Deep Learning Neural Network (including Convolutional)
 - Machine Learning Models (Stochastic Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression)
 - Traditional computer vision algorithm
 
The dataset used for training and testing the models: https://www.kaggle.com/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies. This dataset contains pairs of source images (satellite images) and mask images (segmented maps, black and white, categorized by water and non-water). Most of the written code lines are meant to extract the data, order it, split it to batches, go through it in different ways and so on and so forth.
