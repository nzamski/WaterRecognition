## WaterRecognition
This repository contains all programs, models and results files needed for my research.
Basically, there are 3 types of models built here (from high complexity to low):
 - Deep Learning Neural Networks (including CNNs)
 - Machine Learning Models (Logistic Regression & SGD)
 - Traditional computer vision algorithm (Otsu's Method)
 
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies) used for training and testing the models is publicly accesible. This dataset contains pairs of source images (satellite images) and mask images (segmented maps in white and black, categorized by water and non-water, respectively).
